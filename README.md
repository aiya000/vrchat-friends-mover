# :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: VRChat Friends Mover :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:

This is a way to send friends requests to all friends of an another VRChat account's friends :tada:

TODO: Put pictures onto here to explain the usage.

## Notice
### Why do you want to my VRChat user name and the password?

This requires your VRChat user name and the password, but this is used only for access to VRChat API.

Please check codes of this repository if you are careful :+1:

### Does this advocate my account to ban?

**The possible is almost nothing** if you don't specify `--unsafe-fast`.

Using this script has a **little** possible to advocate ban :relaxed::green_heart:  
This reason depends the limitation of VRChat API.  
Please see below 2 terms and the page.

> - Do not make queries to the API more than once per 60 seconds.
> - Abuse of the API may result in account termination.

- [Disclaimer - VRChat API Documentation](https://vrchatapi.github.io/#/README?id=disclaimer)

But this script avoids that disclaimer by sleeping when you don't specify `--unsafe-fast`.
**Almost OK**.

Please have the risk yourself in any cases. Sorry!
